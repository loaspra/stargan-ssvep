    "\n",
    "To implement the FBCCA method on python, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the parameters for the FBCCA method, such as the number of harmonics (Nh), the weight vector (w), the number of sub-bands (N), and the filter bank design (M1, M2, or M3): (M1: sub-bands with equally spaced bandwidths; M2: sub-bands corresponding to individual harmonic frequency bands; M3: sub-bands covering multiple harmonic frequency bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the reference signals for each stimulation frequency using function 5 (generate_ref_signgal). The reference signals should have a shape of (n_samples, Nh * 2), where n_samples is the number of samples in your signal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a function to perform CCA between two multi-dimensional variables. Use the CCA module from sklearn.cross_decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a function to perform filter bank analysis on your SSVEP signals using a zero-phase Chebyshev Type I IIR filter. You can use the filtfilt() function from scipy.signal to apply the filter. The filter bank analysis should output a set of sub-band signals, each with a shape of (n_samples, n_channels), where n_channels is the number of channels in your signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each sub-band signal, apply the CCA function to calculate the correlation vector between the sub-band signal and the reference signals for each stimulation frequency using equation (5). The correlation vector should have a shape of (1, Nh * 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each stimulation frequency, calculate the feature vector by using a weighted sum of squares of the correlation values corresponding to all sub-band components using equation (6). The feature vector should have a shape of (1, N).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the feature vector with a threshold value to determine the target frequency. The threshold value can be optimized by a grid search method. If the feature vector exceeds the threshold value, then the target frequency is the frequency corresponding to the reference signal. If not, then the target frequency is unknown.\n",
